# Parity

What has to match the original ZolikaPatch 7.65 ASI, and the faults reproduced on
purpose. A guard that turns one of these into a non-fault is a fidelity bug, not a
fix.

## Contracts pinned by tests

| contract | evidence |
| --- | --- |
| INI grammar (feather-ini-parser 1.41): 255-byte line buffer, first-line BOM drops the file, `#`/`//` comments only, strtok-on-`=` keys that keep a trailing space, values that keep their spaces, empty values not stored, last duplicate wins, a re-opened section starts empty, case-sensitive sections and keys | `zp_tests`, `TestConfigGrammar` |
| Read boundary is `std::stoi` on the stored text with the arm's default | `zp_tests`, `TestConfigGrammar` |
| Build classification: the four version fields concatenated (`1.0.7.0` -> 1070, `1.2.0.43` -> 12043) and the original's switch; an unsupported executable is `unknown` and applies nothing | `zp_tests`, `TestBuilds` |
| Option catalogue: 99 keys with the shipped value, the absent-key default and the build mask | `source/options.inc` (generated), `zp_tests` |
| With no arm installed the pipeline changes nothing on any supported image | `zp_dump_empty` (9 images) |
| The generated catalogue and INI cannot drift from their sources | `zp_catalogue_drift`, `zp_ini_drift` |

## Preserved faults

| fault | condition | site |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `std::invalid_argument` escapes the loader | a non-numeric `[Options]` value (`Key=abc`, or `Key= ` of spaces only) | `Config::Integer` -> `std::stoi`, uncaught |
| `std::out_of_range` escapes the loader | a numeric value outside `int` | same |
| the whole INI is dropped | the first line starts with a UTF-8 BOM | `Feather::Parse` |
| null section dereference | a key line before the first `[section]` line | `Feather::Parse` |
| a line longer than 255 bytes is split | the parser's 255-byte line buffer | `Feather::Parse` |

Two of these remain assumptions, not measurements: feather 1.41's non-advancing
`getline` on a long line (the original very likely spins; this tree continues), and
CRLF folding (the original reads in text mode). The shipped INI's longest line is
192 bytes, so the first is unreachable from it.

## Status

Measured on 1.0.8.0 with `tools/parity_report.py 9`:

- **74 of 99 option keys closed**;
- **49 hook bodies transcribed, registered and proven whole** (`zp_body_proof`, a
  linear sweep of each body's exact instruction count); the rest of the original's
  bodies are still to transcribe;
- launcher: `LaunchWithPlayGTAIV` implemented and its slots verified per build
  (`zp_launcher_slots`); SkipLauncher, DFA and ROM are not started;
- the 18 full/per-option per-build dump hashes and the oracle differential are not
  yet produced.

Transcribed and available for the arms that need it (`source/shared.ixx`):
`sub_10003E50` (the `hash:`/quote config-value resolver, 67 instructions) and the
1.0.8.0 `CModelInfoStore::getModelByKey` lookup (`dword_10159C0C`, resolved with the
original's own pattern). `AllowHashesForIDE` needs exactly that resolver (its site is
the game's hash function at `0x45CF50`).

Still blocked:

- `BadPlayerModelCrashFix` needs the ASI's **native-call layer**, not the shared
  helpers: `sub_1005B3F0`/`sub_1005B150`, `sub_100038E0` (an SEH frame around a call
  through `dword_1015BDE0`), `sub_1005DE40`/`80`, plus the GTAC.dll branch
  (`sub_1005B290`, `sub_1005B530`, the sprintf chain) and the original's own
  38,455-entry model-name table at `0x100DE770`;
- `GarageModelFix`, `NoLiveryLimit`, the steer/engine/plane trio and `FreezeCarFix`
  need `sub_10004C70` (the 1,343-byte steer consumer) and, for `FreezeCarFix`, the
  1,421-byte probe;
- `HighQualityReflections` (~200 instructions) and `CutsceneFixes` (~100, with only
  one real baseline byte) are over the transcription budget by design.

`ForceCarHeadlightShadows` cannot match while its baseline cell carries the
reference dump's `0xD0000000` placeholder for a published float pointer; closing it
needs that canonicalisation in `tests/dump_main.cpp`.

## Transcribing a body

A body-bearing key is committed only when all four parts exist:

1. **The body's asm**, transcribed into the owning module's tail, with the recovered
   VA in a comment. A naked function in a module interface unit must be `static` at
   module scope: in a namespace, or with external linkage, MSVC rejects it.
2. **The published module words** the body reads, written *before* the site is
   installed: the original reads a site's original bytes for its resume, so
   publishing after the write resumes into the jump itself.
3. **The registry entry** `Bodies::Register(&body, recoveredVa)`, so the dump can
   express the branch in the original's coordinates.
4. **The proof row** in `tests/bodies.tsv` — name, recovered VA, symbol resolved from
   the linker map, instruction budget — and `zp_body_proof` must PASS.

## What the scoreboard can and cannot compare

`parity_report.py` compares a key's changed bytes against the stored baseline and
excludes **branch displacement bytes**: those baselines wrote one stand-in body
address for every arm, so the four bytes of a displacement are meaningless there.
The set of displacement RVAs is derived from the pristine game image (an `E8`/`E9`
opcode one to four bytes before the RVA), which is the only source that works for an
arm installed over a site that was already a branch.

Because of that exclusion the scoreboard proves bytes but not body identity: an arm
that registers the wrong reference VA still matches. Body identity comes from
`tests/body_targets.tsv` (the arm names its body, the table names its VA) and from
the instruction-level proof.

`verify_bodies.py` sweeps each body linearly for exactly the row's instruction
count, so the manifest budget is the body's true length, not a cap: the budget is
the count to the first `int3` in the original. A row that is short would silently
truncate the proof on both sides, and a row that is long reads into padding (and
fails if either side decodes fewer instructions), which is why the number is part
of the evidence rather than a hint.

Body identity is instruction-level except for a call's target: the proof compares
a `call` as an immediate, not as the function it names. Four implemented bodies
call our equivalent helper instead of the original's compiled target:

- `ped_models_in_cutscenes` calls audio's `ValueResolverThunk`, a
  one-instruction `jmp` through the published resolver slot, because the resolver
  (`ValueResolverBody`) is `static` in `shared.ixx` and an external-linkage naked
  function in a module interface unit is rejected (C2488), so an importer cannot
  emit the original's direct `E8` to it;
- `local_settings_detour` and `local_settings_fallback_detour` call our
  `LocalSettingsStep`, a reimplementation of the original's compiled helper;
- `savegame_fix_copy` calls `SavegameCopyBlock`, which forwards to `std::memcpy`.

The stored baselines have one gap of their own: they were produced by the
reference tree, whose `ApplyCarDynamicShadowFixNoE` pass is defined but never
called, so on 1.0.0.0/1.0.4.0 the baseline lacks the six-byte NOP fill this tree
writes from the recovered `@noE` row. `CarDynamicShadowFix` therefore reports six
extra bytes on 1.0.4.0; it is a baseline omission, not a difference in the bytes
both sides write.

## A preserved fault that the tools cannot measure

`NoImpostorHeightCutoff` reproduces the original's fault on 1.0.0.0: the pattern
matches once and the original writes `hits[1]` through an uninitialised vector
entry (`mov eax,[ebp-0x6C]; mov esi,[eax+4]` at `0x100536F1`, write `66 89 06`). The
arm keeps that shape - no `pattern.size() > 1` guard - so on 1.0.0.0 the dump writes
the first pair (which is exactly what the stored baseline's single pair records) and
then faults `0xC0000005`, as the original does.

Consequence: `parity_report.py 1` and `dump_matrix.py` fault at that arm on
1.0.0.0, so the 1.0.0.0 cell of the 18-cell matrix cannot be measured for keys that
run after it. That is the fault being faithful, not the tree being broken; the
reference tree guards it, which is why its baseline carries only the first pair.
Guarding it here to make a tool happy would be the fault-avoidance divergence the
policy forbids.
