// that occur exactly once wherever they exist (checked against every image in
// game_refs).

// sub_10051A90 reads the caller's bytes into its own 0xE78-byte scratch and keeps

// sub_10023150, recovered VA 0x10023150 (223 instructions to its `ret`): the DLC
// discovery, transcribed instruction for instruction. For each of the two named DLC
// folders it picks one path - the "content" layout if it exists, else the legacy
// fallback - and probes \Episode3\ .. \Episode254\ next to the executable,
// registering every folder that exists and applying it to the object the body was
// entered with (`[ebp+8]`, the argument the fixup body pushes).
//
// It is transcribable: unlike the rest of the rebuilt set its instruction stream has
// no EH frame, no TLS static-init guard and no indexed absolute operand -- the
// /GS cookie is ordinary instructions, every call is a direct `E8` or an absolute
// IAT slot, and every buffer is ESP/EBP-relative. The proof row is why the C++ rebuild
// is gone; docs/rebuilt.md records the evidence and what is left unproven.
//
// Two details are the original's and not the rebuild's invention:
// - The register call is `call esi` with ESI = image base + the stored register RVA
//   and ECX left over from the preceding `strcpy_s`; the callee uses ECX only through
//   the loader callback this key replaces and a branch its non-zero flag skips, so
//   the value is never dereferenced. The transcription leaves ECX alone, exactly as
//   the original does, rather than inventing a `this`.
// - The episode id pushed for the register call is `lea eax,[edi+edi]` -- twice the
//   loop counter -- and the loop runs edi = 3 .. 254 inclusive, which is the original
//   `inc edi / cmp edi,0FFh / jl`.
//
// Naked and internal: an external-linkage naked function is written to the module
// and every importer fails (C2488).
