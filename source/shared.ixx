// The two PlayerAsPedComponentsFix bodies are here rather than in stability.ixx
// because the helper reaches the resolver with a direct `call` (E8, the shape the
// original has) and MSVC rejects an external-linkage naked function in a module
// interface unit: a body that names the resolver has to live in the resolver's
// unit. They are exported by address; the arm that installs them lives in
// stability.ixx, where the key does.

// The exported surface. The functions are declared here and defined below out of
// line: an exported *inline* body would be written to the module's interface and
// would drag the naked declarations into it, which every importer then rejects
