"""Per-key parity scoreboard against the stored baselines.

For every catalogue key, compares our per-option dump with the baseline the old
tree produced, and prints one line per key: matched, missing, extra, differing.
A key is closed only when all four are zero (or both sides are empty). A key whose
difference is a known baseline omission is reported as ORACLE instead of OPEN, on
the builds `tests/oracle_verified.tsv` names for it (never globally), and is never
counted as closed.

    python tools/parity_report.py <build> [--baseline DIR] [--ours FILE]

Defaults: baseline ../readable/build/p3-final-dumps3, ours a fresh per-option
dump of that build. Exit status: 0 when every key is closed, 1 otherwise.
