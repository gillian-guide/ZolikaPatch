"""The 18-cell dump matrix: 9 builds x (full, per-option) against the baselines.

This is the acceptance measurement for the write set. It runs the dump for every
supported image in both modes and compares each cell with the stored baseline,
reporting per build what the full cell wrote, how it differs, how the per-option
scoreboard stands, and which keys are behind the residual.

Every cell is its own subprocess, and a cell that dies with a Windows exception is
a recorded outcome, not an abort. That matters because one cell faults *by
design*: `NoImpostorHeightCutoff` reproduces the original's 1.0.0.0 access
violation (`docs/parity.md`), so build 1's per-option cell dies at that arm. A
fault records:

  * the cell's exit code, printed as the exception code (`0xC0000005`);
  * whatever the cell wrote before it died, kept next to the build as
    `matrix-b<build>-per-partial.txt`, with its size in the report;
  * the key it faulted on -- *measured*, not guessed: the build is re-run one key
    per subprocess, and an isolated single-key cell is exactly that key's rows of
    a per-option cell (`--selfcheck-isolated` proves it on a build that does not
    fault). A fault in the shared per-option loop hides every key after it and the
    stdio block hides the rows before it, so the per-key fallback is both what
    makes a faulted cell measurable and what proves no *other* key faults there.
